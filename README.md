# Rethinking Remote Sensing Image Captioning:
From Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to
Knowledge-Driven Training-Free Adapter


To illustrate this discrepancy, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we project captions from several widely-used natural and RS
datasets into a shared semantic space using MPNet and perform clustering analysis.  The results reveal stark differences:
natural images exhibit dispersed clusters with diverse semantic relationships due to object diversity and varying perspectives.
In contrast, RSIs captured from fixed aerial/satellite perspectives form compact, overlapping clusters dominated by structured geographic entities.

To demonstrate the accuracy and detail of captions generated by our method, we conducted a qualitative comparison with RS-LLaVA, GeoChat, and VHM on two representative scenes: aircraft and ships.
